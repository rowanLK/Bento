# Bento Javascript Game Engine

Bento is a modular, component based Javascript game engine. 

## Installation

Install Node.js and use `npm install`. To build the engine, use the `gulp` command. If you don't want to build you can also just get bento.js from the build folder and include this in your game.

## How to use

Easiest way to get started for now is to download a copy of [Bento Empty Project template](https://github.com/LuckyKat/Bento-Empty-Project)
